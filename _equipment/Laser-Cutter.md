##### General information

This is the primary laser-cutting machine in the DBE Maker Space. It has
a higher-power laser system which allows for precise and fast processing of
projects. It is still important to carefully check any files with the technical
team to ensure a complete understanding of the timeframes of any work. It is an
efficient machine but there is only 1 machine available which can cause delays
in results to high demand.&#x20;

This equipment is strictly operated only by the technical team. Students
can assist in the process, but the use of the machine can only be done by a
technician.&#x20;

No risk assessment is required, but Makerspace induction is mandatory.
