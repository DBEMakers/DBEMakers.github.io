## SP 500

![SP 500](/assets/images/equipment/SP500_NoBackground.png)

This is the primary laser-cutting machine in the DBE Maker Space. It has a higher-power laser system which allows for precise and fast processing of projects. It is still important to carefully check any files with the technical team to ensure a complete understanding of the timeframes of any work. It is an efficient machine but there is only 1 machine available which can cause delays in results to high demand.

This equipment is strictly operated only by the technical team. Students can assist in the process, but the use of the machine can only be done by a technician.

No risk assessment is required, but Makerspace induction is mandatory.

### Setting up your files

#### Vector lines



<li> Vector files need to be DRAWN in the vector program rather than just imported or pasted in there. Also opening a vector file in a raster file program, such as Photoshop, will convert it to a raster image. </li> 


### Line weight

#### Process colors
To process any file, it is required that the PDF only have the following colours:
 
<ul>
    <li> Cut = <strong style="color: red;"> RGB Red </strong> </li>
    <li> Vector engrave = <strong style="color: green;"> RGB Green </strong> </li>
    <li> Raster engrave = <strong style="color: blue;"> RGB Blue </strong> </li>
</ul>
