## General Information

{% include cards.html %}
{: .mb-7 .mt-3}

Laser cutters use high-power laser system which allows for precise and fast processing of projects. It is still important to carefully check any files with the technical team to ensure a complete understanding of the timeframes of any work.

**The SP 500:** It is an efficient machine but there is only 1 machine available which can cause delays in results to high demand.

**Emblaser 2's:** The emblaser 2 is a small desktop laser cutter that allows for small projects to be processed with extra safety guards to avoid risks of major injury.

## Documentation

### Setting up your files

#### Vector lines

<li> Vector files need to be DRAWN in the vector program rather than just imported or pasted in there. Also opening a vector file in a raster file program, such as Photoshop, will convert it to a raster image. </li> 

### Line weight

#### Process colors

To process any file, it is required that the PDF only have the following colours:

<ul>
    <li> Cut = <strong style="color: red;"> RGB Red </strong> </li>
    <li> Vector engrave = <strong style="color: green;"> RGB Green </strong> </li>
    <li> Raster engrave = <strong style="color: blue;"> RGB Blue </strong> </li>
</ul>

##### Examples

#### File format

* PDF format is the only file received in the maker space to process any laser cutting job. Ensure that you

#### Naming format

* StudentID\_MaterialThickness\_MaterialSize.PDF

#### Setup file in AutoCAD

#### Setup file in Illustrator

#### Setup file in Rhino

This is a test.
