Due to the large number of students within DBE, it is important that all students follow the listed procedures and policies. Ignorance is not an excuse for failing to adhere to the policy or procedures.

[Book an Induction](https://siso.curtin.edu.au/sodbe//){: .btn .btn-primary }

## 1. Supervision
Before using any equipment or in an emergency, please signal to one of the technicians to assist you and supervise. Do not use any of the equipment without a technician’s approval. Children under the age of 16 must be accompanied by a parent or Curtin faculty, staff, or student. Users must also complete an induction prior to using equipment in the Makerspace. Failure to do so will result in access being revoked.

## 2. Appropriate Attire
To use equipment and working within the B418 Makerspace you are required to wear enclosed shoes. If you do **not** wear appropriate footwear you will be **denied** access to the facilities and to the equipment. It is required that you wear safety glasses and, when in the high-tech space that you wear ear muffs to protect yourself.

Both pieces of equipment will be provided upon entry and must be cleaned after use.

## 3. Equipment Use
Users of the DBE Makerspace cannot create objects that endanger themselves or others. Technicians have the right to refuse your project if it does not meet this requirement.


## 3D Printing
### Guidelines

1. Users must hand-deliver files via USB to technicans for review. Once reviewed you may be asked to go and amend your model if there are any errors. Please see the [Ultimaker equipment](mailto:dbe-technicalsupport@curtin.edu.au) for more information.

2.  Users must submit their files in one of the following formats for printing:
.stl or .obj.

### Costs
1. 3D printing – the cost for printing is currently $0.11 per gram.

2. Upon sending a file to use for printing, we will give you a quote for the cost of your project. If you are happy with the amount we will begin printing.

3. Please pay via [payments.curtin.edu.au/School-of-Design-and-the-Built-Environment](https://payments.curtin.edu.au/School-of-Design-and-the-Built-Environment/menu). Cash payments are not accepted.

The DBE Makerspace reserves the right to modify this policy at any time, and costs are subject to change.
