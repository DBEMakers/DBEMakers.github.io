        <p> Due to the large number of students within DBE, it is important that all students follow the listed procedures and policies. Ignorance is not an excuse for failing to adhere to the policy or procedures.
        <br><br>
        In order to use the Makerspace and its equipment, you will need to book an induction. Inductions can be general or specialised so please specify what equipment you would like to use. Induction types include general inductions for the Makerspace, Wood & Metal workshops; Laser Cutting; And 3D Printing. Completing an induction will reward you a sticker for that respective induction (see reference image).
