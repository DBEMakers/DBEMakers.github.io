# ‘At the Fence’ Exhibition
{: .mb-3}

![LIMEN Poster](/assets/images/exhibitions/LIMEN 2.0/LIMEN Poster.png)

## What is LIMEN 2.0?
Limen 2.0 – ‘At the fence’ recreates few charged moments from the institutionalisation at 3 mission sites – Mogumber/Moore River, Carrolup/Marribank and Wandering mission. We cross the fence to enter into a shared space to engage with the Survivors, to hear their story at the place they spent their years of childhood feeling lost, isolated, traumatised and stolen.

Our experience of Limen – ‘At the fence’ will encourage empathy and provides an alternative view of the Stolen Generation experience that has been distorted, filtered and transformed through a colonial lens. ‘At the fence’ holds a hope that Indigenous and non-Indigenous people of Australia will hold hands and cross over the fence.
